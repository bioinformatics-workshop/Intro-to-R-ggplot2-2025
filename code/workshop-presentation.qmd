Go to the GitHub repository <https://github.com/bioinformatics-workshop>

Select the workshop [**Intro-to-R-ggplot2-2025**](https://github.com/bioinformatics-workshop/Intro-to-R-ggplot2-2025)

Click on the `<> Code` button and copy the HTTPS URL

In the terminal tab in Rstudio (in the console section), type in `git clone` and paste the URL from github (see below)

`git clone https://github.com/bioinformatics-workshop/Intro-to-R-ggplot2-2025.git`

Now, you should have a clone of the workshop documents with scripts and html files to follow.
